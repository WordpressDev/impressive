An impress.js presentation generator


  
This is my impress presentation generator.  
You have to solve a few steps until your presentation is generated.  
First you'll have to create some content. Make sure to name it like  
the step id in impress (example: cnt/start.cnt json/start.json <div id="start" ...>)  
  

Tutorial short (long will follow)  
(Note: Do this all in your exec/ folder)  
1) Create your content files in exec/cnt/  
2) Create JSONs by using the impressive_json-generator.py  
    -> Remember to add the content first to exec/cnt/!  
3) execute run.py with json folder as argument (./run.py json)  
    -> If executed in exec/
